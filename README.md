# Notes_330

System for organizing notes

The note_contents file contains a Note class, which stores data about a note. This includes its optional unique id, mentions, topics, references, and URLs. Note objects are distinguished by the file name from which they were read.

The note_group file contains the NoteGroup class, which takes in a collection of Note objects and provides methods useful for sorting them.
